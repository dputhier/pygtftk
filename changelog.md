## v1.5.0

### Bug Fixes


### API/CLI Changes


### Code changes

### API/CLI Changes


### Code changes

* OLOGRAM doc has been  updated.

* Added test for Beta distribution fitting.

### New Features

* OLOGRAM now gives the p-value for S as fitted through a Beta distribution. However, Beta distributions are harder to fit, since
unavoidable small errors in the estimation of the skewness and kurtosis will propagate. In practice it is preferable to approximate this with a Negative Binomial. This will be explained in the manuscript.

### API/CLI Changes

*   OLOGRAM will now also produce separate histograms for each combination length.

*   The --chrom-file argument now accepts "mm8_ens", "mm9_ens", "mm10_ens", "hg19_ens", "hg38_ens", "rn3_ens" and "rn4_ens" which correspond to internal chromosome info files in ensembl format (i.e. no 'chr' prefix) (#146).

*   OLOGRAM has two new arguments (--hide-undef and --pval-threshold) to hide undefine or high p-values.

*   ologram_modl_treeify has a new argument (--min-inheritance) to add combinations only if they represent a given proportion of an existing parent.

*   In OLOGRAM-MODL, whether to use exact combinations or not (should A+B+C count as an observation of A+B ? Yes if not exact) is now controlled by an argument (--exact).

*   Added an argument to OLOGRAM to hide bars with undefined p-values (#149).

### Code changes

*   Minor optimizations to overlap computing.

*   pygtftk now requires Python >=3.8, <3.9.

*   Major optimizations to OLOGRAM's handling of RAM using newly-created structures.

*   Reduced OLOGRAM time cost by removing operations (computation of relative combination exactitude) that were not needed.

*   OLOGRAM's statistics computation with multiprocessing now uses a batch system instead of individual jobs.

## v1.2.0

This version introduces OLOGRAM-MODL, a new paradigm for OLOGRAM to find intersections between multiple sets of genomic regions at once and then compute their enrichment with OLOGRAM. An optional algorithm (MODL) to find interesting combinations with sparse dictionary learning and greedy submodular optimisation has also been added. Furthermore, it also contains major speedups to OLOGRAM itself.

*   Moved OLOGRAM-related commands to their own section in the documentation.

*   The MODL algorithm for combination mining can be accessed independantly.

### Code changes

*   Major speedups achieved in OLOGRAM by better typecasting in the Cython code.

## v1.0.0

### Bug Fixes

### API Changes

### Code changes

*   Many typo detected and fixed.

### New Features

*   This version now integrates ologram (OverLap Of Genomic Regions Analysis using
    Monte Carlo). Ologram annotates peaks(in BED format) with region sets/features
    extracted from (i) GTF file features (e.g promoter, tts, gene body, UTR...) (ii)
    GTF file keys (e.g. gene_biotype, user defined keys...) (iii) or from a BED file.

*   The user can now use --chrom-info to provide the command with a file or a string.
    The string should be one of 'mm8', 'mm9', 'mm10', 'hg19', 'hg38', 'rn3' or 'rn4'.
    When a genome version is requested as a string, the conventional chromosomes
    are used (chrM is discarded together with alternative haplotypes,
    unlocalized regions...).

## v0.9.10

### Bug Fixes

*   Argparse was part of the dependencies. However, argparse is part of Python 3.
    Thus, this caused pygtftk to come with an older version of argparse...

*   Fixed gene sorting in tss_dict to ensure reproducible result.

*   Fixed a problem with retrieve() when used from interpreter (#45).

*   The load_gtf() function (C API) no raise an error if a GFF3 is passed
    with .gtf extension.

### API Changes

*   Input BED file in bed3 format are now converted to bed6 automatically.

*   The select_by_numeric() function has been renamed eval_numeric()

*   It is now possible to use numpy array of booleans to index the GTF (i.e.
    using the indexing function).

*   the prepare_gffutils_db() function allows one to create a db for
    gffutils while selecting features and attributes.

### Code changes

*   The argformatter module was refactored. Development of FormattedFile(argparse.FileType)
    that test for file extension and content (at least for bed).

*   The BED conversion is now performed using the print_bed() C function .

### New Features

## v0.9.9

### Bug Fixes

*   Fix a critical bug in get_sequence that affected get_feat_seq and get_tx_seq.

*   Select_by_key now throw an error when no key/val are available.

*   No more function with mutable objects as default arguments.

*   Fix temporary file deletion.

### API Changes

*   Refactored arg_formatter by  creating a single type (ranged_num)
to test for numeric inputs.

*   Refactored all plugins so that there is no more reference to
unused arguments (tmp_dir, verbosity...).

### Code changes

*   No more reference to PY2.

*   Added several test to get_tx_seq and get_feat_seq.

*   Added several script to manipulate fasta files (see 'tools' folder).
    For pygtftk dev.

*   Added 'extra_require' slot in setup().

*   The get-feature-seq program now relies on bedtools (not on internal C code).
    This may change in the future as a a more
    flexible C interface is available.

### New Features

*   Added --list-bigwigs to profile (to display the content of a coverage file).

*   Added a novel dataset	(mini_real_10M) derived from mini_real and containing
    10 Mb of chr1.

*   The configuration directory now supports several subdirectories named based
    on a hash string computed from path to the gtftk program.

## v0.9.8

### Bug Fixes

*   Convergent and divergent return coordinate (e.g. dist_to_divergent)
in integer not float...

### API Changes

*   pygtftk is no more compatible with python 2. This decision aims at
    integrating last plotnine versions (starting from 0.5.1) that
    depends on matplotlib 3.0.0 which strictly depends on py3k.

### New Features

*   Added an example for col_from_tab in presentation.rst

*   Added a dataset mini_real_coding_pot.tab.

*   Working on travis now.

*   gtftk configuration directory now contains several subdirectories whose
    names are computed based on gtftk program location.

*   Added a -d argument to gtftk program. This argument returns gtftk
    configuration directory.

*   All tests should be independent of the directory.

*   Added test to count_key_values.

## v0.9.7

### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed a bug in add_attr_from_file. The arg has_header led to empty result.
